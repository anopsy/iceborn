Little tool for a quick EDA based on polars

##I'd like to create a package that will perform EDA on polars dataframe
the goal is to:
    *get acquinted with polars 
    *create a handy tool for quick eda

## EDA
-shape of the dataframe
-missing values
-data types
-basic stats for continous variables
-value counts for categorical
-basic plots (boxplots/histograms) this will be interesting as polars df aren't compatible with matplotlib/seaborn
